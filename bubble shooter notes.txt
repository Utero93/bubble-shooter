bubble shooter notes

randomSize variable? Would you not want a uniform size for the particle effects

bounce back feature? Disabled currently but not helping with lag
enemy death animation? Particles have been disabled but still lagging

calculate the trajectory of the shots, map that angle to the ship so it rotates and tracks when the ship shoots

particles dissapear on contact with target and when it leaves the boundary? Possible reason for the lag, too many particles
